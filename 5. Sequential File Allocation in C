5. Sequential File Allocation in C
Code:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
FILE *file = fopen(&quot;testfile.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;);
if (file == NULL) {
printf(&quot;Error opening file.\n&quot;);
return 1;
}
fprintf(file, &quot;Hello, this is a sequential file allocation test.\n&quot;);
fclose(file);
printf(&quot;File written successfully.\n&quot;);
file = fopen(&quot;testfile.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
char ch;
while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
putchar(ch);
}

fclose(file);
return 0;
}
Expected Output:
File written successfully.
