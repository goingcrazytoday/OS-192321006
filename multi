1. Multithreading in C
A simple C program that demonstrates multithreading using the pthread library.
Code:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
// Function to be executed by threads
void *printMessage(void *thread_id) {
int id = *((int *)thread_id);
printf(&quot;Thread %d is running\n&quot;, id);
sleep(1);
printf(&quot;Thread %d is exiting\n&quot;, id);
return NULL;
}
int main() {
pthread_t threads[3];
int thread_ids[3] = {1, 2, 3};
// Creating threads
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
pthread_create(&amp;threads[i], NULL, printMessage, (void
*)&amp;thread_ids[i]);
}
// Joining threads
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
}
printf(&quot;All threads completed\n&quot;);
return 0;
}
Expected Output:
Thread 1 is running
Thread 2 is running
Thread 3 is running
Thread 1 is exiting
Thread 2 is exiting
Thread 3 is exiting
All threads completed
